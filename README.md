## About the Video Course
Deep learning is the next big thing. It’s a part of machine learning. Its favorable results in applications with huge and complex data is remarkable. R programming language is very popular among data miners and statisticians. 
This course will help you resolve problems during the execution of different tasks in deep learning, neural networks, and advanced machine learning techniques. We start with different packages in deep learning, neural networks, and structures. We’ll also encounter the applications in text mining and processing along with a comparison between CPU and GPU performance. It will also take you through complex deep learning algorithms and various deep learning packages and libraries in R. 
By the end of the course, you’ll have an understanding of deep learning and different deep learning packages so you have the most appropriate solutions for your problems.
